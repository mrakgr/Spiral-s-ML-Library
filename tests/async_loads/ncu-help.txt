                                          (profile only the application process)
                                          all
                                          (profile the application and its child processes)
  --target-processes-filter arg         Set the comma separated expressions to filter which processes are profiled.
                                          <process name> Set the exact process name to include for profiling.
                                          regex:<expression> Set the regex to include matching process names for 
                                        profiling.
                                            On shells that recognize regular expression symbols as special characters,
                                            the expression needs to be escaped with quotes.
                                          exclude:<process name> Set the exact process name to exclude for profiling.
                                          exclude-tree:<process name> Set the exact process name to exclude
                                            for profiling and further process tracking. None of its child processes
                                            will be profiled, even if they match a positive filter.
                                        The executable name part of the process will be considered in the match.
                                        Processing of filters stops at the first match.
                                        If any positive filter is specified, only processes matching a positive filter 
                                        are profiled.
  --null-stdin                          Launch the application with '/dev/null' as its standard input. This avoids 
                                        applications reading from standard input being stopped by SIGTTIN signals and 
                                        hanging when running as backgrounded processes.

                                        Skip entries that shouldn't be matched, e.g. use "::foobar:2" to match the 
                                        second invocation of "foobar" in any context or stream. Use ":7:regex:^foo:" to
                                        match any kernel in stream 7 beginning with "foo" (according to 
                                        --kernel-name-base).
  -k [ --kernel-name ] arg              Filter the kernel in one of the following ways:
                                          <kernel name> Set the kernel name for an exact match.
                                          regex:<expression> Set the regex to use for matching the kernel name.
  --kernel-name-base arg (=function)    Set the basis for --kernel-name, --kernel-id and kernel-name:
                                          function
                                          demangled
                                          mangled
  --rename-kernels arg (=1)             Perform simplification on the kernel demangled names.
                                        Rename demangled names using a config file. By default, searches for 
                                        ncu-kernel-renames.yaml config file in the current working directory and 
                                        "$HOME/.config/NVIDIA Corporation" directory. Use --rename-kernels-export 
                                        option to export the simplified demangled names to the config file.
  --rename-kernels-export arg (=0)      Export renamed or simplified kernel demangled names to the config file.
                                        By default, exports the ncu-kernel-renames.yaml config file in 
                                        "$HOME/.config/NVIDIA Corporation" directory.
  --rename-kernels-path arg             Override the default path to kernel demangled names config file. Only valid 
                                        while renaming or exporting the kernel demangled names.
  -c [ --launch-count ] arg             Limit the number of collected profile results. The count is only incremented 
                                        for launches that match the kernel filters.
  -s [ --launch-skip ] arg (=0)         Set the number of kernel launches to skip before starting to profile. The count
                                        is incremented for launches that match the kernel filters only.
  --launch-skip-before-match arg (=0)   Set the number of kernel launches to skip before starting to profile. The count
                                        is incremented for all launches.
  --section arg                         Collect the section by providing section identifier in one of the following 
                                        ways:
                                          <section identifier> Set the section identifier for an exact match.
                                          regex:<expression> Set the regex to use for matching the section identifier.
                                        If option is not specified, the default section set is collected.
                                        Section metrics that cannot be collected will usually generate a warning only.
  --metrics arg                         Specify all metrics to be profiled, separated by comma.
                                        Names passed to this option support the following prefixes:
                                          regex:<expression> Expands to all metrics that partially match the
                                                             expression. Enclose the regular expression in
                                                             ^...$ to force a full match.
                                          group:<name>       Lists all metrics of the metric group with that
                                                             name. See section files for valid group names.
                                          breakdown:<metric> Expands to the input metrics of the high-level
                                                             throughput metric. If the specified metric does
                                                             not support a breakdown, no metrics are added.
                                        If a metric requires a suffix to be valid, and no prefix is used this option 
                                        automatically expands the name to all available first-level sub-metrics.
                                        Metrics that cannot be collected will generate an error.
  --disable-extra-suffixes              Disables the collection of extra suffixes (avg, min, max, sum). Only collect 
                                        what is explicity specified.
  --nvtx-include arg                    Adds include statement to the NVTX filter, which allows selecting kernels to 
                                        profile based on NVTX ranges.
  --nvtx-exclude arg                    Adds exclude statement to the NVTX filter, which allows selecting kernels to 
                                        profile based on NVTX ranges.
  --range-filter arg                    Filter to profile specified instance(s) of matching NVTX ranges or start/stop 
                                        ranges created through cu(da)ProfilerStart/Stop APIs
                                        Specify in format <yes/no/on/off>:<start/stop range instance(s)>:<NVTX range 
                                        instance(s)>
                                           <yes/no/on/off> : default is 'no/off'. If set to 'yes/on' then NVTX range 
                                        numbering starts from 1 inside every start/stop range.
                                           Numbers can be provided in regex form e.g, [2-4] or 2|3|4 to profile 2nd, 
                                        3rd and 4th instance of the matching range.
                                           NVTX range numbers will be counted for matching range provided using 
                                        --nvtx-include.

PM Sampling Options:
  --pm-sampling-interval arg (=0)       Set the PM sampling interval in cycles or ns (depending on the architecture),

                                        2 ^ (5 + value) cycles. If set to 'auto', the profiler tries to automatically 
                                        determine a high sampling frequency without skipping samples or overflowing the
                                        output buffer.
  --warp-sampling-max-passes arg (=5)   Set maximum number of passes used for warp state sampling.
