// Since Spiral v2.6.0 the default int and floats are set in the plugin settings.
// The two types are also provided based on that by the language itself.

// type int = i32
// type float = f32

// Having 32 bit ints and floats is a good setting for Cuda related backends as Nvidia GPUs do not have hardware
// support for 64 bit int arithmetic, and limited support for 64 bit floats.

// In truth, I didn't want these settings to be passed in during startup, but all the other ways had severe flaws.
// Passing the `int` and `float` through the type system in foralls wouldn't have worked for type literals for example.
// Having the settings be backend specific wouldn`t have meshed with providing editor support.
// Having the defaults be specified in the package.spiproj files would result in modules packaegs having separate defaults.

// Specifying them in the plugin settings was the best choice in the end.
