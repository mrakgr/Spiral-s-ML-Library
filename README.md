# Spiral's ML Library

In this project we're experimenting on making games that run on the GPU, and training RL agents using them. Check out the [Youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL04PGV4cTuIVP50-B_1scXUUMn8qEBbSs) for more.

The language used for most of the code here is [Spiral](https://github.com/mrakgr/The-Spiral-Language).

More info will be added on this page later.
